# -Police-Dataset-Analysis
This repository contains my Day 3 Data Analysis project, where I performed a complete exploratory data analysis using Python. The goal of this project is to clean the dataset, handle missing values, visualize patterns, and extract actionable insights.

🔧 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked shape, columns, and structure

Detected missing values in each column

Filled null values using mean, median, or mode based on data type

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, std, min/max)

Correlation analysis

Trend analysis (sales & profit patterns)

Categorical breakdown of products, customers, and regions

3️⃣ Data Visualization

Created visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn:

Bar charts

Line plots

Histograms

Scatter plots

Heatmap (Correlation Matrix)

📈 Outcome / Insights

Identified top-performing regions

Highlighted best-selling product categories

Found seasonal trends in sales

Observed relationships between sales, quantity, and profit

Provided business-ready insights
